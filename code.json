    "description": "This repository houses a set of Python tools to expedite the acquisition of 3DEP DEM data. These tools were designed to help geologists in the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program more efficiently produce high-resolution base maps and tailored derivative products that help identify and characterize geologic features. These derivatives include hillshades and slope maps, as well as more complex derivatives.",
